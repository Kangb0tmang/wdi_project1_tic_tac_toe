# Readme for Tic Tac Toe Project

Scope for the project:   
https://gist.github.com/epoch/e39f6bdacd260f18e3139066c03de037#file-wdi13_project1-md   

Link to the game:

(No sound yet, so its ok if you have your speakers on full blast)   

## Approach
- Created a flowchart to figure out the processes, logic and function names.   
- Use Javascript, CSS, HTML, images to build the game.   
- Separate into functions to work on one feature at a time.   
- Get core functionality working then add CSS and additional features etc.   

## Cool Tech
- Additional features in planning/design stage:   
- I.e. Sound, number of rounds, ability for player to select images, additional transitions and animations.

## Challenges
- Starting the project. Where to start???   
- Choosing a theme, layout and colours.   
- Coming up with new ideas and implementing them.   

## Lessons Learned
- Use the debugger.  
- Always have a plan.  
- No need to link javascript code directly to DOM elements. End up spending way too much time changing code to match the DOM object. Print it out on the console instead.  
- Good to have a plan, but no need to make an elaborate plan for a 3 day project.   
- Always ask for help!   
- Don't overthink, just do it.   
- Don't be afraid to try new things.
